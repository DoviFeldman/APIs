ok simple instructions for me:

add this code function within the <script> tags of any github pages:


"

async function trackVisitor() {
  const res = await fetch('https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/visitor-tracker?page=homepage');
  const data = await res.json();
  document.getElementById('stats').innerHTML = `
    Unique visitors: ${data.uniqueVisitors}
    Your visits: ${data.yourVisits}
    Location: ${data.location}
  `;
}

trackVisitor();

"

go to this URL to see everyone who viseted your website:
"
https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/get-visitors?page=homepage
"

ok now.
the  "?page=homepage" part of this link: 
"https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/visitor-tracker?page=homepage"
and this link:
"https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/get-visitors?page=homepage"
, the visitor tracker link and the get visitors link, 

show what page they visit, and lets me see the page that they visit,

so i think if i had another github pages that i wanted to track, or another page that i wanted to track, i just change the "homepage" part, 
and when i visit the link i change it to the same name that i changed it to, and then i can seperatly track 2 different pages.

also: 
"https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/visitor-tracker?page=homepage"
go to this link, the visitors trackers, to increase the count to test it to see if it works.

...


yes! 
It worked! 

this is now a thing: 
"https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/visitor-tracker?page=jeff"

"https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/get-visitors?page=jeff"

so i should use that in my next gihub pages. 
Sweet! 

Vercel as a backend API totally works!!!!!
