ok simple instructions for me:

add this code function within the <script> tags of any github pages:


"

async function trackVisitor() {
  const res = await fetch('https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/visitor-tracker?page=homepage');
  const data = await res.json();
  document.getElementById('stats').innerHTML = `
    Unique visitors: ${data.uniqueVisitors}
    Your visits: ${data.yourVisits}
    Location: ${data.location}
  `;
}

trackVisitor();

"

go to this URL to see everyone who viseted your website:
"
https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/get-visitors?page=homepage
"

ok now.
the  "?page=homepage" part of this link: 
"https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/visitor-tracker?page=homepage"
and this link:
"https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/get-visitors?page=homepage"
, the visitor tracker link and the get visitors link, 

show what page they visit, and lets me see the page that they visit,

so i think if i had another github pages that i wanted to track, or another page that i wanted to track, i just change the "homepage" part, 
and when i visit the link i change it to the same name that i changed it to, and then i can seperatly track 2 different pages.

also: 
"https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/visitor-tracker?page=homepage"
go to this link, the visitors trackers, to increase the count to test it to see if it works.

...


yes! 
It worked! 

this is now a thing: 
"https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/visitor-tracker?page=jeff"

"https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/get-visitors?page=jeff"

so i should use that in my next gihub pages. 
Sweet! 

Vercel as a backend API totally works!!!!!


Counter Button instructions for me(tested):


https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/counter?id=my-button

and this is just total how many times someone viseted this link and it shows in in the json.

so i can make a github pages that when they press a button it presses the link and then it also fetches from the same link to see how many times they clicked the button.

or like if someone scans a qr code it visits a github pages with the vercel api link which incraments it and then gets the data from the same vercel api link to see how many people actually viseted the site from scanning the qr code. 

and also i can make different pages in the github pages reposetory that diffferent qr codes go to so i can have many qr codes that only show how many people scanned that particular qr code.

https://apis-pearl-eight.vercel.app/api/counter?id=my-button1

this one i also visited so it shows 1 and its added to the database as an example.
