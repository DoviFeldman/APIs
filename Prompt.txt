Claude 4.5 Sonnet with extended thinking

make me a github code, ideally very simple with very few files, that i can connect and run on vercel, that makes that vercel project the ability to act like APIs for my other projects like github pages that i make, i want it to be all in 1 vercel project that i can allways just add more apis and stuff for whatever kind of things i need.

when i say API i mean something right beyond what github pages can do(cause its static), i want to be able to like send messages to another thing, that the vercel api will act as the server that connects them, or as a temporary text holder, like for a github pages website idea "upload a quote to see the previously uploaded quote", where vercel "API" would store the previous quote so the next visitor could see it, and also maybe a "scan this qr code to see how many people scanned this qr code" where its just a simple github pages that every time someone visits the website from the qr code it requests or sends their ip address to the vercel API so that it can track and then display how many people have visited the website before, these are just so you know what im saying when i say i want vercel to act as an API for me, just very simple things.

dont make all those projects for me, just code the vercel project structure and tell me the instructions and how to set it up simply(i have github and vercel), so that i can just make a new API thing in like 1 github file and add it to the github repo and the vercel will update automatically but the setup will all be setup, i want to keep all my apis in one vercel project.

the API projects to code for me are just the scan this qr code to see how many people scanned this qr code, or press this button to see how many people pressed this button(similar), and also one that whenever people visit a website i can see their ip addresses general city location or something, and their unique thing and how many times they viseted the website, i can view it either on a vercel database(idk, ive never done that before) or another github pages, whichevers simpler
